# sdg-engine: a simple data generation engine for computer vision
_If you are looking for the old version of `sdg-engine` I've stored it in [this branch](https://github.com/federicoarenasl/sdg-engine/tree/deprecated-main), the tutorial can be found [here](https://federicoarenasl.github.io/sdg-engine/)._

A simple interface for synthetic data generation for computer vision using rendering engines.

By following some conventions (more below), you can basically set up any scene in Blender and `sdg-engine` will output an annotated dataset importable into 🤗  HuggingFace `datasets` to be used in your downstream Computer Vision tasks.

Enjoy simple synthetic data generation!

> Notes/Disclaimers:
> - Currently only interfaces with Blender, but should be extendable to others.
> - This is a work in progress and the interface might change.

## Installation
Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/federicoarenasl/sdg-engine.git
```
Install dependencies using `poetry` (if you don't have poetry you can easily install following the steps [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-pipx)):
```bash
poetry install
```
This will create a virtual environment locally at `.venv`, simply activate this before running the project.
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

> Note: Currently Blender's `bpy` package is included as part of the dependencies. Depending on your internet speed, this will take a short while.

## Running `sdg_engine` using Blender
In order for `sdg_engine` to remain minimal while illustrative for you to generate your own synthetic datasets, I've included a functional example that you can replicate which generates data replicating the open-source TYO-L dataset.

You can also use your own scenes by following the instructions below.
### From the example included
This is composed of two files:
- [`tyless-5-objects.blend`](sdg_engine/core/interfaces/blender/scenes/tyless-5-objects.blend): This is the actual Blender `.blend` scene.
- [`example.config.yaml`](sdg_engine/example.config.yaml): This is the configuration for that indicates `sdg_engine` which `.blend` scene to use, where to save the data, and how to perform a sweep over the scene in order to generate meaningful data.

Copy and paste `example.config.yaml` into your own `config.yaml`.

### From your own example
You'll have to follow some conventions I've setup to make the actual setup super easy.

Open Blender (if you haven't installed it yet, you can do so [here](https://www.blender.org/download/)) and:
1. Copy and paste the example [`tyless-5-objects.blend`](sdg_engine/core/interfaces/blender/scenes/tyless-5-objects.blend). Rename it to a name of your liking.
2. In your new scene, make sure to name your objects with easily identifiable names.
3. Spend as much time as you would like styling your scene to your liking.
4. Keep the camera and axis as they are in the example scene, **do not delete nor move these**.

Finally, update the configuration YAML `sdg_engine` will use to generate data:
1. Copying and pasting the `example.config.yaml` into your own `config.yaml`, replace `scene_path` with the path to your new `.blend` file.
2. Update the `scene_name` to the name of the scene in your `.blend` file.
3. Update the `element_names` to the names of the objects in your scene.
4. Update the `target_path` to the path where you want to save the data.

### Generating the dataset
Once you have your scene set up, you can generate data by running:
```bash
poetry run python -m sdg_engine.core.main --config config.yaml
```

This will produce a dataset with the following structure in your `target_path`:
```bash
.
└── train # or validation or test, depending on the split in the config
    ├── 1ed8d595-fb93-4d7b-87bc-d060a66a0b66_annotated.png
    ├── 1ed8d595-fb93-4d7b-87bc-d060a66a0b66.png
    ├── 4a283977-67aa-4485-aefe-4fcbf3a74731_annotated.png
    ...
    ├── f3b8cc29-de80-4b52-961c-a00ec237767c_annotated.png
    ├── f3b8cc29-de80-4b52-961c-a00ec237767c.png
    ├── annotation_animation.gif
    └── metadata.jsonl
```

By default, the `config.yaml` has debug mode enabled, this will:
- save an additional image with the rendered bounding boxes on top of the original image, hence the `_annotated` suffix.
- save an animation of the annotated images at `target_path/<split>/annotation_animation.gif`.

The animation GIF is super helpful to visualize the data you've just generated, see it
below for the `example.config.yaml` configuration.

## Pushing your dataset to the 🤗 Hub

Once you have your dataset saved, you can push it to the 🤗 Hub by running:
```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("imagefolder", data_dir="path/to/your/dataset")
dataset.push_to_hub("your-username/your-dataset-name")
```

I've included an example notebook in the `examples` folder to push the dataset to the 🤗 Hub, check it out at [`examples/push-dataset-to-hub.ipynb`](examples/push-dataset-to-hub.ipynb).


## Tutorials
There will be a tutorial on how to use the generated dataset in a downstream Computer Vision task using 🤗 Transformers and 🤗 Datasets in my website [federicoarenas.ai](https://federicoarenas.ai).

Stay tuned for the tutorial at [federicoarenas.ai/projects/sdg-engine-applied](https://federicoarenas.ai/projects/sdg-engine-applied)
